# Project Description
This project demonstrates the application of Machine Learning, specifically deep neural networks, in identifying transcription-factor binding sites in DNA sequences. Utilizing a synthetic dataset of DNA sequences, the goal is to predict the presence of a specific transcription factor indicated by labels (1 or 0) using a developed machine learning model.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of DNA sequences that are either regulated by a specific transcription factor (label 1) or not (label 0).

# Methodology
Data Loading and Preprocessing: The data is loaded and preprocessed using one-hot encoding to transform the DNA sequences into a matrix format, suitable for machine learning algorithms.

# Model Building: 
The project involves building and training a deep neural network, with convolutional layers to detect motifs indicative of binding sites.

# Model Evaluation: 
The model is evaluated on a test dataset, with performance metrics such as accuracy and a confusion matrix being computed.

# Saliency Map Analysis: 
To interpret the model, saliency maps are computed to identify which parts of the DNA sequences most influence the model's predictions.

# Implementation
The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with detailed steps and code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. Users can experiment with different model architectures and parameters.
